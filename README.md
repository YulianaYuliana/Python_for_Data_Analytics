## Else after For
The else function after for is the priority function in search loops - to provide a program exit when the search is not found

## Break
- The break statement is used to stop the iteration process in the for or while statement.
- The break statement stops the loop and then exits, followed by executing the statement after the loop block.
- If you have a nested loop, break will stop the loop according to the level or loop it is in.
- However, if it is placed in a second depth loop, for example, only that loop stops, not the main loop.

##Continue
- The continue statement will make the current literacy stop.
- Then move on to the next literacy.
- Ignore statements that are between continue and the end of the loop block.
