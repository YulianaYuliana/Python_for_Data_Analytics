## Else after For
The else function after for is the priority function in search loops - to provide a program exit when the search is not found

## Break
- The break statement is used to stop the iteration process in the for or while statement.
- The break statement stops the loop and then exits, followed by executing the statement after the loop block.
- If you have a nested loop, break will stop the loop according to the level or loop it is in.
- However, if it is placed in a second depth loop, for example, only that loop stops, not the main loop.

## Continue
- The continue statement will make the current literacy stop.
- Then move on to the next literacy.
- Ignore statements that are between continue and the end of the loop block.

## While
-	In Python, "while" is used to execute statements as long as the given condition is met or True.
-	The condition can be any expression, and please note that in Python, True includes non-zero values.
-	When the condition becomes False, the program will proceed to the line after the statement block.
-	Remember to increment the limit, or else the loop will continue forever.

## Else after While
In a while statement, the else block will always be executed when the condition in the while becomes false

## List Comprehension
- List comprehension in Python is an easy and compact syntax for creating a list from a string or another list.
- It is a very concise way to create a new list by performing an operation on each item in the existing list.
- List comprehension is considerably faster than processing a list using the for loop. <br>

## Function
- In mathematics, a function is a process that relates between an input and an output.
- In Python, apart from these relational functions, functions are also a way to organize code - with the ultimate goal of code being reusable (reusability)
- it is best if the function has only one specific use but can be reused
- common functions are provided by Python
- But we can always define our own functions  

### Defining a Function
- Functions are defined with the keyword def followed by the name of the function and its parameters in brackets ( )
- Optionally, you can add a docstring – a documentation string that explains the context of the function.
- The code block in each function starts with a colon and uses indentation
- The function stops when there is a return [expression] statement that returns [the expression to the caller.
- You can also make a function return no output with return none.

Another Example:  
We want to create a function to calculate the area of a triangle

### Return
The optional return statement symbolizes the return of values ​​from the Function to the calling code
